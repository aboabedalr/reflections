I have always thought as a programmer that I needed some knowledge 
in the Unix command line since it has a lot of functions that could help me
also it is important when using mysql

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I think it is very important to keep old versions of files so if something happen to my project I could easily fix it 

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
pros: knowing when to save 
      knowing where to look 
cons: forgetting when to save 

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
I would say it is reasonable for Git to save multiple files since it is indicated for programmers. 

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
i can use to keep track of my changes on codes 

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
i will use it whenever i have a project for school or outside
